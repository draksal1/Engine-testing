# Engine-testing
Ð¡onsole application that tests the operation of the of the engine using 2 tests.

To use engine simulation, you need a configuration file in a specific format. An example is in the folder with the interface. The format is as follows:

Inertia

M1, M2, M3 ... Mn

V1, V2, V3 ... Vn

Toverheating

Hm (Coefficient of dependence of heating rate on torque)

Hv (Coefficient of dependence of heating rate on crankshaft speed)

C (Coefficient of dependence of cooling rate on engine and ambient temperature
ambient temperature)
